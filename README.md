# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 :
Import NumPy as np. It is used for in-built functions.
### Step 2:
Create a nested list named A.
### Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.inv() function, we can find the inverse of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
Display the inverse of the matrix and end the program.

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: A.RAFSHAAN AHMED
#RegisterNumber: 212224230214
import numpy as np
A=[[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]]
inv=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(inv)
```
## Output:
